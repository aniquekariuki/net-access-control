# Network Simulation Files

This is where I've saved the actual Packet Tracer files. If you want to see how the network behaves, you can download these and run them yourself.

### What's in here?

| File | What happens when you open it? |
|------|-------------|
| [**baseline_network.pkt**](baseline_network.pkt) | This is the "Before" state. Everyone is on the same subnet and there's no security. |
| [**secured_network.pkt**](secured_network.pkt) | This is the final working project. It has the VLANs, the QoS limits, and the port security turned on. |

> **Note:** To open these files, you'll need to have **Cisco Packet Tracer (Version 8.0 or higher)** installed on your machine.
