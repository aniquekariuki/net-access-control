# Project Screenshots and Proof

I've captured these screenshots directly from my Packet Tracer simulation to show exactly what I built and how it works.

### The Diagrams

| File | What it shows |
|------|-------------|
| [**current_network.png**](current_network.png) | The basic, unoptimized network we started with. |
| [**proposed_network.png**](proposed_network.png) | My new design with everything segmented into VLANs. |
| [**security_violation.png**](security_violation.png) | **The Proof!** This photo shows the switch shutting down a port because a laptop was plugged into a PC's spot. |
