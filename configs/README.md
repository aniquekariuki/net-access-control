# Router and Switch CLI Scripts

This folder contains the actual configuration commands I used to build the network in Packet Tracer. Each file is broken down by section so you can see exactly what each group of commands does.

| File | What it setup |
|------|-------------|
| [**edge_router_config.md**](edge_router_config.md) | The "Brain" of the network. It handles the VLAN routing, DHCP, and the QoS bandwidth limits. |
| [**lab_switch_config.md**](lab_switch_config.md) | The security layer. It handles the VLAN splitting, the sticky MAC port security, and DHCP snooping. |
